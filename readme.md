In the following project, we have to implement an interactive
application that monitors the physical activity of the user depending on the
mean of transportation.\
A user can be walking, staying still, or, for example, driving a car.\
The goal of the project is to display the user with an interface where they can start/stop
one of these activities and these will be recorded in a local database.\
The user can get access to all the activities done by seeing them in a calendar and receive the report of the monthly activities through plots.\
Furthermore, when the user is walking/running, we also want to record his/her number of steps taken per activity chunk, so that we know how many steps one person has made daily.\
The app also provides the user with a background functionality that performs activity recognition.
